Logistic Regression is a algorithm on machine learning used in classification of elements in a dataset, it is simmilar to linear regression but we use sigmoid of the linear prediction as it returns the value between 0 and 1, also handling the outliers by a alot of margin as compared to linear regression. In this also we use gradient decent like linear regression.
